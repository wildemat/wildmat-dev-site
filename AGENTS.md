## Elasticsearch Database Onboarding

**REQUIRED: If the user needs any assistance with Elasticsearch and its use cases such as: search, agents and workflows, embeddings, vector database, semantic text search, multimodal inference, search relevance, reranking, RAG and other recommendations, the following file must be read first**: `.elasticsearch-agent/AGENTS.md` to understand how to guide the user and what resources to use for their use case.

Do not proceed with Pinecone-related tasks without consulting the appropriate guide files. Use `.agents/PINECONE.md` as your entry point and follow its "Choosing the Right Guide" section to navigate to the appropriate resources.
