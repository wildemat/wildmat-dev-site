I will be competing in a trivia around the Rudolph movie. The transcript of the movie is in the project files. Questions won’t be the pedantic type such as what color is this bell on the tree or how many birds were flying in the background. The questions will center around the script, themes, the lessons learned and taught by characters. There will also be questions that are funny when applying the script to the modern political and social climate. For example there will be questions about funny lines like the reindeer calling Rudolph a rainbow puss or the reindeer father acting somewhat racist.

Generate sample questions using the script with varying difficulty and ensure you especially highlight the parts of the script that were normal for the 60s and its political climate in America but seem funny and off putting in modern times.
