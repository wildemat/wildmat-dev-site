# Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer/Transcript | Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer Wiki | Fandom  
This is the transcript for the Rudolph the Red-Noised Reindeer film) by Rankin/Bass.  
  
The opening sequence shows live-action footage of a snowstorm, and newspaper articles' headlines appearing. The footage then shows a title card which reads, "Rankin/Bass Presents" and then follows with a snowman, who is wearing a waistcoat and a bowler hat, and is carrying an umbrella.>>  
  
Sam The Snowman: (to the audience)    
"If I live to be a hundred, I'll never be able to forget that big snowstorm a couple of years ago. The weather closed in and.... well, you might not believe it, but the world almost missed Christmas." (tips his hat)    
"Oh, excuse me! Call me Sam. What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen a talking snowman before?" (picks up his umbrella and glides through the snow. A forest of Christmas trees comes into view)    
"Nice around here, isn't it? I call it Christmastown, better known as the North Pole. The Christmas Tree Forest. Yep. Here's where we grow 'em. Nice place to live, you know." (passes by seals playing with Christmas presents)    
"Christmas seals. Of course, the number one citizens up here are the Clauses-- Santa and the Missus. They live right over there." (scene pans right to Santa's workshop)    
"First castle on the left. Matter of fact, the only castle on the left." (chuckles)  
  
<<The scene fades to the inside of the castle, to see Santa, seated at the dining room table, and Mrs. Claus, standing beside him, holding his red coat.>>  
  
Mrs. Claus: "Papa, you haven't touched a morsel! I'll have to take this suit in! Eat!"  
  
Santa: "I'm busy, Mama! It's almost Christmas!"  
  
Mrs. Claus: "Whoever heard of a skinny Santa? Eat! EAT!"  
  
<<Scene goes back to>>  
  
Sam the Snowman: "Now, don't any of you worry your heads about Santa! Mrs. Claus will have him plenty fattened up by Christmas Eve. It's always the same story." (takes a deep breath and sighs happily)    
"I love this Christmassy time of year. Especially when everything is running happily and smoothly as it is this season. Nothing like that year of the big snowstorm." (shivers)    
"I don't know what we would've done without Rudolph to pull us through. Anyway.... hmmm, Rudolph? Huh! Could it be that some of you are not acquainted with the story of Rudolph?" (props his umbrella in the snow, and pulls an ice block toward him, with the intent to use it as a seat)    
"Well, pull up an ice block and lend an ear. Now you know how Santa uses these flying reindeer to pull his sleigh. You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen, Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen" (singing)    
♪"But do you recall The most famous reindeer of all?"♪  
  
<<Opening credits begin, with a sign saying, "Burl Ives Tells the Story of", then the title card: "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer", followed by the credits>>  
  
    
Sam the Snowman: (speaking)    
"Well, now, let me tell you about Rudolph. It all started a couple of years before the big snow."  
  
<<Scene fades to a cave of the Donner family>>    
(Sam's voice-over:)    
"It was springtime, and Santa's lead reindeer, Donner, had just become a proud papa."  
  
Donner: "Nyaahh! We'll ...We'll call him Rudolph."  
  
Mrs. Donner: "Rudolph is a lovely name. Rudolph."  
  
Donner: (as infant Rudolph, wakes and looks up at him) "Hey, he knows his name already!"  
  
Rudolph: (his red nose suddenly glows like a red light) "Papa. Mama."  
  
Mrs. Donner: (awestruck) "He's... He's got a shiny nose."  
  
Donner: "Sh-sh-shiny? I'd even say it glows!"  
  
Mrs. Donner: "Well, we'll simply have to overlook it."  
  
Donner: "How can you overlook that? His beak blinks like a blinking beacon!"  
  
<<Santa enters the cave>>  
  
Santa: "Ho, ho, ho. Well, Donner, where's the new member of the family? After all, if he's going to be on my team someday, he'd better get to know me. Ho, ho, ho. (to Rudolph) Well, hi there. Aren't you the sturdy little fellow?"  
  
Rudolph: "Santa?"  
  
Santa: (chuckles) "And smart too."  
  
<<Rudolph's nose shines, much to Santa's amazement>>  
  
Santa: "Great bouncing icebergs!"  
  
Donner: "Now I'm sure it'll stop as soon as he grows up, Santa."  
  
Santa: "Well, let's hope so, if he wants to make the sleigh team someday. (to Rudolph) You see, little fellow, every year I shine up my jingle bells... for eight lucky reindeer."    
(singing) ♪Jingle, jingle, jingle You will hear my sleigh bells ring I am old Kris Kringle I'm the king of jingle-ing. ♪(grabs a collar of jingle bells) ♪Jingle, jingle, reindeer Through the frosty air they'll go,♪ (Donner flies) ♪ They are not just plain deer They're the fastest deer I know, ho ho.♪ (Rudolph gets up and falls down) ♪You must believe that on Christmas Eve. I won't pass you by.♪ (Rudolph gets up again, and walks to a jingle bell collar and puts his head through it) ♪I'll dash away in my magic sleigh. Flying through the sky. Jingle, jingle, jingle. You will hear my sleigh bells ring. I am old Kris Kringle, I'm the king of jingle-ing. I am old Kris Kringle, I'm the king of jingle-ing Ho ho! ♪ (Santa departs)  
  
Rudolph: "Bye-bye."  
  
Donner: "Oh, Santa's right. He'll never make the sleigh team. Wait a minute! I've got it! We'll hide Rudolph's nose."  
  
Mrs. Donner: "Hide it?"  
  
Donner: "Nnnyah." (to his son) "Come here, boy." (He scrapes up a some soil and covers Rudolph's nose with it) "You'll be a normal little buck just like everybody else, right? A chip off the old antlers. Now, now. You'll get used to it. Put it there, son. (Rudolph cuddles against him) Aw, gee."  
  
(Mrs. Donner kisses Rudolph's nose, accidentally wiping off the soil disguise. Rudolph's nose shines. Donner looks at her and she kisses Rudolph’s nose again.)  
  
<<Scene fades back to Sam>>  
  
Sam the Snowman: "For the first year, the Donner's did a pretty fair job of hiding Rudolph's, uh, nonconformity. <<Scene fades to Donner and Rudolph playing>>    
(Sam's voice-over):    
"Donner taught Rudolph all the ins and outs of being a reindeer: how to get food, how to fight off enemies, things like that. But most important...    
(a sudden loud roaring sound is heard, and the two reindeer hide behind a snowbank, as two white fuzzy feet are seen walking past)    
Sam continues:    
"Most important of all, he taught his son to beware of the Abominable Snow Monster of the North. He's mean, he's nasty, and he hates everything to do with Christmas."    
(They emerge from hiding, and Rudolph jumps down into one of Bumble's huge footprints)  
  
<<Scene fades to nighttime outside Santa's castle.>>    
"Now, aside from the Abominable, business goes on as usual. And soon it is right before Christmas, and everybody is getting ready for that big, big sleigh ride on the night of the 24th-- Christmas Eve!    
<<Scene fades to the interior of the castle where Santa's elves are at work with toys>>    
"See, all the toys Santa brings are made by these elves. Seems elves have that certain knack for toy-making. All except for this...this one misfit..."  
  
Foreman Elf: "Hermey! Aren't you finished painting that yet? There's a pile-up a mile wide behind you. What's eating you, boy?"  
  
Hermey: "Not happy in my work, I guess."  
  
Foreman Elf: "What?!"  
  
Hermey: "I just don't like to make toys."  
  
Foreman Elf: "Oh, well, if that's all.... WHAT?! You don't like to make toys?"  
  
Hermey: "No."  
  
Foreman Elf: (to the other elves) "Hermey doesn't like to make toys!"  
  
(The elves repeat the phrase along down the line, and then they all turn to Hermey and say, in unison, ):  
  
"Oh, shame on you!"  
  
Foreman Elf: " Do you mind telling me what you DO want to do?"  
  
Hermey: "Well, sir, someday I'd like to be a...a dentist."  
  
Foreman Elf: "A dentist?!"  
  
Hermey: (holds up a book of dentistry) "Well, we need one up here. I've been studying. It's fascinating. You've no idea. Molars and bicuspids and incisors."  
  
Foreman Elf: "Now, listen, you. You're an elf, and elves make toys. (pushes away Hermey's dentistry book with the unfinished wagon) Now get to work!"    
<<a factory whistle is heard>>    
Foreman Elf: "Ten minutes break!" (Hermey starts to leave)    
"Not for you! Finish the job, or you're fired!" (He departs)  
  
Hermey: (singing; to himself) ♪"Why am I such a misfit? I am not just a nitwit. You can't fire me, I quit! Seems I don't fit in."♪  
  
Sam the Snowman: Ah, well. Such is the life of an elf. Meanwhile, Rudolph is having his growing pains, too. Old Donner is determined to keep Rudolph's nose a secret.  
  
<<Scene fades to the reindeer cave>>  
  
Donner: (holding a round, hollow piece of black cap to his son) "All right, son. Try it on."  
  
Rudolph: "I don't wanna. Daddy, I don't like it."  
  
Donner: "You'll like it and wear it."  
  
Rudolph: "Oh, but, Daddy! (Donner pops it onto Rudolph's nose) "It's not very comfortable!"  
  
Donner: "There are more important things than comfort: self-respect. Santa can't object to ya NOW."  
  
(Rudolph sadly walks outside, sits and removes the fake nose)  
  
Rudolph: (singing) ♪"Why am I such a misfit? I am not just a nitwit. Just because my nose glows. Why don't I fit in?"♪  
  
Sam the Snowman: "And so time passes. Christmas comes and goes on schedule, and soon it is April. That's when all the new fawns come out with their folks... to meet the other new fawns, AND to be inspected by Santa."  
  
<<The reindeer fawns are being brought to school by their parents>>  
  
Donner: "Now, don't worry about your nose, son. Just get out there and do your stuff. Remember, you're my little buck." (He shoves Rudolph toward the group. Another fawn of the same age introduces himself)  
  
Fireball: "Hi. My name's Fireball. What's yours?"  
  
Rudolph: "Rudolph."  
  
Fireball: "Come on. you can be my buddy."  
  
Rudolph: "Where are we going?"  
  
Fireball: "To the reindeer games. Makes antlers grow. Besides, it's a great way to show off in front of the does. Come on!"  
  
Sam the Snowman: "Ah, youth. Meanwhile, the elves are bustling with activity. Christmas is over, but they still keep busy with lessons in elf improvement."  
  
Foreman Elf: "All out for elf practice!"  
  
(The elves are lining up for their choir, in front of Santa and Mrs. Claus, who are seated on their thrones.)  
  
Santa: "Well, lets get this over with. I have to go down and look over the new deer."  
  
Foreman Elf: "OK, Santa. (to other elves) "Now let's try out the new elf song I wrote. And remember, it's for Santa! And a-one-a and a-two-a and a-three-a..."  
  
Elves: (singing) ♪"Ho ho ho, ho ho ho. We are Santa's elves! We are Santa's elves. Filling Santa's shelves. With a toy for each girl and boy. Oh, we are Santa's elves."♪

(Mrs. Claus applauds.)  
  
Santa: "Hmm. Well, it needs work. I have to go". (He departs)  
  
Mrs. Claus: "What does Papa know? It's beautiful. You keep it just the way it was." (follows Santa) "Papa? Papa!" (door closes behind her)  
  
Foreman Elf: "That sounded terrible! The tenor section was weak!"  
  
Elf: "Wasn't our fault, boss. Hermey didn't show up."  
  
Foreman Elf: "WHAT?!"  
  
<<Scene fades back to the workshop where Hermey is busy checking the dolls' teeth>>  
  
Hermey: (to a doll he's holding) "Now this won't hurt a bit." (An enraged Foreman bursts in through the door)  
  
Foreman Elf: "Why weren't you at elf practice?"  
  
Hermey: "Just fixing these dolls' teeth."  
  
Foreman Elf: "Just fixing--" Now, listen! We have dolls that cry, talk, walk, blink, and run a temperature. We don't need any chewing dolls!"  
  
Hermey: "I just thought I found a way to...to fit in."  
  
Foreman Elf: "You'll NEVER fit in! (walks back to the door) Now, you come to practice and learn how to wiggle your ears and chuckle warmly and go _hee hee_ and _ho ho_ and important stuff like that. A dentist! Good grief!" (He slams the door behind himself)  
  
Hermey: (to himself) "No. I just can't. It's like he said: I'll never fit in. (grabs his dentistry book, opens a window, and climbs through) I...I guess I'm on my own now."  
  
<<Scene fades back to the reindeer school, where Rudolph and Fireball are playing>>  
  
Fireball: (to Rudolph) "Hey look! Does! (Rudolph turns to see a group of young does) Hey, whaddaya know? One of them likes ya."  
  
Rudolph: "Yeah, Fireball? You really think so?"  
  
(Coach blows his whistle)  
  
Fireball: "Uh-uh, here comes the coach."  
  
Comet: "All right. All right, yearlings. All right, now! (the fawns quiet down) That's better. My name is Comet. And even though I'm your instructor, I want to be your pal. Right? Right. My job is to make bucks out of ya. So let's go. (blows his whistle) Now then, our first game is called, 'Takeoff'. We all want to pull Santa's sleigh someday, don't we? So we must learn to fly. Now, who's first to try? (all the fawn shout) One at a time! ONE AT A TIME! (picks one of the fawns) You. You're Dasher's little boy, aren'tcha? You go first."  
  
All fawns: "Aww..."  
  
Comet: "All right now. The whole trick is getting up enough speed and jumping into the wind. You got it? Go ahead." (The fawn tries, but falls flat. The other fawns laugh) Very good for a first try. Next!"  
  
Fireball: "He won't get to us for a while yet. Now's your chance to get acquainted with that doe!"  
  
(Rudolph approaches the doe with the bow on her head)  
  
Clarice: (to Rudolph) "Nice day?"  
  
Rudolph: (shyly) "Yup..."  
  
Clarice: "For takeoff practice, I mean."  
  
Rudolph: "Yup..."  
  
Clarice: "I bet you'll be the best."  
  
Rudolph: (blushes) "Aw, I don't know."  
  
Clarice: "Something wrong with your nose? I mean, you talk kind of funny."  
  
Rudolph: "What's so funny about the way I talk?"  
  
Clarice: "Well, don't get angry. I don't mind."  
  
Rudolph: "You don't?"  
  
Clarice: "My name's Clarice. Hi."  
  
Rudolph: "My name's Rudolph. Hi."  
  
Clarice: "Hi."  
  
Rudolph: "Hey, uh, Clarice... after practice, would you-- would you-- ?"  
  
Comet: (calling) "Rudolph, you get back here! It's your turn, you know!"  
  
Rudolph: "Gee, I got to go back. (starts to run off, but then turns back) "Would you walk home with me?"  
  
Clarice: "Uh-huh...Rudolph, I think you're cute."  
  
Rudolph: (jumps for joy, and begins to fly up in the air) "I'm cute! I'm cuuuuute!!" (lands on the ground in front of Comet)  
  
Comet: "Magnificent!"  
  
Rudolph: "I'm cute! I'm cute! She said I'm cuuuuute!!" (airborne again, much to the awe and amazement of the other fawns, his parents, and Santa)  
  
Santa: Not bad! Not bad a-tall!"  
  
(Rudolph lands in front of Fireball)  
  
Fireball: "Hey, you're okay!"  
  
Rudolph: "She said I'm cute! Ha ha!"  
  
(they laugh and spar, until Rudolph's fake nose pops off, and his own nose starts to glow red)  
  
Fireball: "For cryin' out loud!"  
  
Rudolph: "Fireball, what's the matter?"  
  
Fireball: "G-g-get away! G-g-get away from me!"  
  
Comet: "Now, now, now, now! What's this nonsense here, bucks? After all-- Gaaah!"

Comet: (blows his whistle) "All right, all right now, yearlings. Back to practice. (Rudolph is halted by Comet) Oh, no. Not you. You'd better go home with your folks. From now on, gang, we won't let Rudolph join in any reindeer games, right?"  
  
Fawns: "Right!"  
  
(Rudolph runs off to the forest, followed by Clarice)  
  
Clarice: "Rudolph? Rudolph! Rudolph."  
  
Rudolph: "Well, what do YOU want?"  
  
Clarice: "You... you promised to walk me home."  
  
Rudolph: "Aren't you going to laugh at my nose, too?"  
  
Clarice: "I think it's a handsome nose, much better than that silly false one you were wearing."  
  
Rudolph: "It's terrible. It's different from everybody else's."  
  
Clarice: "But that's what makes it so grand. Why, any doe would consider herself lucky to be with you."

(As Bumble climbs back onto land, he turns and gives an angry roar) "Yukon Cornelius scores again! Whoopee! (He repeats his pickaxe routine search, but...) "Nothin'."  
  
Rudolph: (to Yukon) "Uh, Mister, where are we going?"  
  
Yukon: "You're going to stay with me and we'll all be rich... with the biggest silver strike this side of Hudson Bay. SILVER!"  
  
Hermey: "I thought you wanted gold."  
  
Yukon: (airily) "I changed my mind."  
  
Sam the Snowman: (voice-over) "Yessir, our friends were really on their way, but not one of them knew where they were going."  
  
    
<<Scene fades to the reindeer cave, where Rudolph's parents are worrying about their son.)  
  
Sam the Snowman: (voice-over) "Now you can bet old Donner felt pretty badly about the way he had treated Rudolph. And he knew the only thing to do... was to go out and look for his little buck. Mrs. Donner wanted to go along, naturally, but Donner said, 'No, this is man's work.' (Donner leaves his wife in tears, and Clarice arrives) "And no sooner did the man of the house leave when Mrs. Donner and Clarice decided to set out on their own.    
<<Scene returns to the group on the iceberg raft>>    
Now, they were really taking their chances because, you see, that little ice boat had run into a pack of mighty wicked fog."  
  
Yukon: "Hullo-o-o-o! Fog's thick as peanut butter."  
  
Hermey: "You mean pea soup!"  
  
Yukon: "You'll eat what you like and I'll eat what I like. NYAAH!!" (Their iceberg raft hit land, causing the three to tumble) "LAAAAND HOOOOOOOO!!!!!"  
  
Hermey: "No kidding."  
  
Rudolph: 'Where are we?"  
  
(They see a castle on top of a high peak. Then, Yukon Cornelius points up to the sky, where a winged lion is flying) "Hey, looky up there."  
  
Rudolph, Hermey and Yukon: (in awe) "Oh..."  
  
(Stepping back, Hermey bumps into a purple box, causing the lid to pop up, and a figure to suddenly emerge from it)  
  
Jack-in-the-box: "Halt! Who goes there?"  
  
Yukon: "Us, of course. Who'd you think?"  
  
Jack-in-the-box: "Oh well, that's okay. Okay? Who, may I ask, are you?"  
  
Rudolph: "We're Rudolph, Hermey, and Yukon Cornelius, sir. Who are you?"  
  
Jack-in-the-box: "I'm the official sentry of the Island of Misfit Toys."  
  
Hermey: "A jack-in-the-box for a sentry?"  
  
Jack-in-the-box: "Yes. My name is-- "  
  
Rudolph: "Don't tell me. Jack?"  
  
Jack-in-the-box: (sadly) "No. Charlie. That's why I'm a misfit toy. My name is all wrong. No child wants to play with a "Charlie-in-the-box", so I had to come here."

(The trio go into the throne room, where King Moonracer is seated on his throne)  
  
King Moonracer: "Come closer. What do you desire?"  
  
Rudolph: "Well, we're a couple of misfits from Christmastown, and now we'd like to live here."  
  
King Moonracer: "No. That would not be possible. This island is for toys alone."  
  
Yukon: "How do you like that? Even among misfits, you're misfits."  
  
King Moonracer: "Unlike playthings, a living creature cannot hide himself on an island. But, perhaps, being misfits yourselves, YOU might help the toys here."  
  
Rudolph: "Help them?"  
  
King Moonracer: "Yes. When someday you return to Christmastown, would you tell Santa about our homeless toys? I'm sure HE could find little boys and girls who would be happy with them. A toy is never truly happy until it is loved by a child."

<<Scene ends with the Aurora Borealis lighting the nighttime sky, and with the distant roar of the unseen Bumble>>  
  
    
Sam the Snowman: "Well, time passed slowly. Rudolph existed as best he could. The snow monster kept him on the run... but once in a while, he would stop and make a friend or two. (Rudolph is playing with the polar bear cubs, but then their mother growls, telling Rudolph to leave) But it wouldn't last long, and Rudolph would be on his own again. But during all that time, a strange and wonderful thing was happening... Rudolph was growing up, and growing up made Rudolph realize that you can't run away from your troubles. And pretty soon he knew where he had to go: home."    
(When Rudolph returns Christmas Town, the other reindeer begin to make fun of him again)

Sam the Snowman: (voice-over) "Well, he was just about to leave when suddenly... (fades to the snowstorm, showing a shingle from the castle's roof being blown away) It hit! (showing the wind blowing away two Eskimos and their igloo) The storm of storms, and only two days before Christmas Eve."  
  
(Christmas trees are being denuded of their ornaments, and elves are struggling to hold on to their packages)  
  
Sam the Snowman: (voice-over) "Now, Rudolph knew that he had to find his folks right away, and he knew where he had to look: the cave of the Abominable Snow Monster.  
  
(Rudolph looks inside, and to sees his parents and Clarice being held captive by Bumble. Bumble picks up Clarice)  
  
Rudolph: (to Bumble) "Put her down!"

<<Scene fades back to Sam, who shields himself with his umbrella, shuddering as he envisions the scene>>  
  
Sam the Snowman: "Ooohh! Tell me when it's over. Oh, where was I? Their last chance. Not quite. You see, ever since Rudolph left them, Hermey and Yukon Cornelius had tried to find their friend. Well, they arrived in Christmastown just as the storm hit, and it was a good thing that I sent them right out after Rudolph."  
  
Hermey: (points to the Bumble's cave)    
"Hey, look!"  
  
Yukon: (to his team): "Whoah! WHOAH! Un-mush, will ya?!"  
  
(They approach the cave's entrance and peek in)  
  
Hermey: 'What do we do? We can't let that monster get ahold of them."  
  
Yukon: "I've got an idea. Listen." (whispers into Hermey's ear)  
  
Hermey: "Uh-huh. Yes. And then? (Yukon whispers again) Not bad. It might work."  
  
(Inside, the three reindeer surround Rudolph's unconscious body)  
  
Clarice: (crying) "Oh, why doesn't he get it over with?"  
  
Rudolph: (coming to) "Pa? Ma? Clarice!"  
  
Hermey: "Are you sure we can get him to come out here?"  
  
Yukon: (climbs up onto the top of the cave's entrance) "Never knew the Bumble snow monster yet who'd turn down a pork dinner for deer meat. Do your stuff! (Hermey makes pig noises) Put some heart in it! That Bumble's hungry!"  
  
(Hermey oinks loudly, turning Bumble's attention away from the reindeer. As Bumble emerges, Yukon uses his pickaxe to drop a boulder on him)  
  
Yukon: "Wahoo! Terrible weather we've been having. Snow and ice! All right, dentist, you take it from here!"

Yukon: (to Bumble) "Why, blast your hairy bumble hide."  
  
Hermey: (walks underneath Bumble) "Don't let this big blowhard scare you anymore. Just walk right past him."  
  
(Bumble gropes inside his mouth, and discovers that he is now toothless. We see Hermey with the extracted teeth.)  
  
Yukon: "I tell you, you're looking at a mighty humble bumble. (Bumble roars) He's nothing without his choppers. Let me at him. Wahoo! (He and his dogs begin driving Bumble backwards to the edge of the cliff. They launch themselves at Bumble, causing all of them to fall off the cliff)  
  
Rudolph and Hermey: "YUKON!"  
  
Rudolph: "He's gone! Oh, he's gone!"  
  
Sam the Snowman: (voice-over) "Well, they are all very sad at the loss of their friend, but they realize that the best thing to do is to get the women back to Christmas Town. So, they make it back, and when everybody hears their story, they start to realize maybe they were a little hard on the misfits. Maybe... misfits have a place, too. Even Santa realizes that maybe... HE was wrong."  
  
Santa: "Rudolph, I promise, as soon as this storm lets up, I'll find homes for all those misfit toys."  
  
Foreman Elf: (to Hermey) "All right. You can open up a dentist office. Next week, after Christmas."  
  
Hermey: "Come here. Open your mouth. Oh, dear. Tsk tsk tsk. I'd better set up an appointment for you: week from Tuesday, 4:30-- sharp!"  
  
Donner: "And I'm sorry, too, Rudolph, for the way I acted."  
  
(A loud knock is heard on the doors, and a man's voice is heard):    
"Open up! It isn't a fit night out for man nor beast!"  
  
(two elves open the doors, letting in a swirl of snow, and Yukon Cornelius, accompanied by his five dogs, enters)  
  
Yukon: "Here's the man... (pulls on a rope to reveal Bumble) and here's the beast! Now, calm down, calm down. I reformed this Bumble! He wants a job. Looky what he can do! (Bumble places a star on the top of the Christmas tree) And he doesn't even need a stepladder!"  
  
Rudolph: "But...but...you went over the side of the cliff!"  
  
Yukon: "Didn't I ever tell you about Bumbles? Bumbles bounce!"

Mrs. Claus: "Eat, Papa, eat."  
  
Santa: "How can I eat? That silly elf song is driving me crazy."  
  
Mrs. Claus: "You're going to disappoint the children. They expect a fat Santa."  
  
Aviator Elf: (to Santa Claus) "Latest weather report, sir."  
  
Santa: "Well, this is it. The storm won't subside by tonight. We...we'll have to cancel Christmas."  
  
Mrs. Claus: "Papa, are you sure?"  
  
Santa: "Everything's grounded! Oh, the poor kids. They've been so good this year, too. But I couldn't chance it. I'll have to tell everybody that it's all off this year. (He goes to the big Hall, where everybody is busily working) "Quiet! Quiet! Please, everybody quiet! Quiet! I've got some bad news, folks. Christmas is going to be canceled. (everybody gasps) There's nothing I can do. This weather-- (just then, Rudolph's nose glows near Santa's face) Rudolph, Rudolph, please! Could you tone it down a bit? I mean, that nose of yours. I-- (he gazes in amazed realization at Rudolph's nose) That nose! That beautiful, wonderful nose!"  
  
Rudolph: "Huh?"  
  
Santa: (joyfully) "Rudolph, Christmas is not off, and you're going to lead my team!"  
  
Rudolph: "I am?"  
  
Santa: "Yes, sir. (Rudolph's nose glows brighter) You and that wonderful nose of yours."  
  
Rudolph: "My nose, sir?"  
  
Santa: "Ho, ho, ho! From what I see now, that'll cut through the murkiest storm they can dish up. What I'm trying to say is... Rudolph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"  
  
Rudolph: "It will be an honor, sir."

Donner: (to his wife) "I knew that nose would be useful someday. I knew it all along!"

Toys: (singing) ♪"If we're on the Island of Unwanted Toys, we'll miss all the fun with the girls and the boys. When Christmas day is here. The most wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, Wonderful day of the year"♪  
  
Rudolph: "Hey, we're all misfits, too. Maybe we could stay here for a while?"  
  
Charlie: "Well, You'd have to get permission from King Moonracer."  
  
Rudolph: "Who's he?"  
  
Charlie: "He rules here. Every night, he searches the entire earth. When he finds a misfit toy, one that no girl or boy loves, he brings it here to live on this island 'til someone wants it. He's holding court in his castle right now."  
  
(The trio go into the throne room, where King Moonracer is seated on his throne)  
  
King Moonracer: "Come closer. What do you desire?"  
  
Rudolph: "Well, we're a couple of misfits from Christmastown, and now we'd like to live here."  
  
King Moonracer: "No. That would not be possible. This island is for toys alone."  
  
Yukon: "How do you like that? Even among misfits, you're misfits."  
  
King Moonracer: "Unlike playthings, a living creature cannot hide himself on an island. But, perhaps, being misfits yourselves, YOU might help the toys here."  
  
Rudolph: "Help them?"  
  
King Moonracer: "Yes. When someday you return to Christmastown, would you tell Santa about our homeless toys? I'm sure HE could find little boys and girls who would be happy with them. A toy is never truly happy until it is loved by a child."  
  
Rudolph: "When and if we ever get back, we'll tell Santa, sir."  
  
King Moonracer: "Good. You are free to spend the night. (claps his front paws twice) Footman! (a spotted elephant appears) Show our friends to their chambers."  
  
<<Scene shows Rudolph, Hermey, and Yukon tucked in for the night>>  
  
Hermey: (to Rudolph) "No. It's all settled. We leave tomorrow together."  
  
Rudolph: "But the Abominable will see my nose and get us all. I've got to go alone."  
  
Yukon: "Nonsense. It's all for all... I mean, one... Ahh, let's get some shut-eye."  
  
Rudolph: "But-- "  
  
Hermey: "It's all settled."  
  
(Hermey clicks off the light and he and Yukon fall asleep, snoring loudly.)  
  
Sam the Snowman: (voice-over) "Well, poor Rudolph realizes that he can't endanger his friends' lives anymore. And so, that night, he decides to strike out on his own."  
  
Rudolph: (sailing back to the North Pole on the iceberg raft) "Good-bye, Cornelius. I hope you find lots of tinsel. Goodbye, Hermey. Whatever a dentist is, I hope, someday, that you're the greatest."  
  
<<Scene ends with the Aurora Borealis lighting the nighttime sky, and with the distant roar of the unseen Bumble>>  
  
    
Sam the Snowman: "Well, time passed slowly. Rudolph existed as best he could. The snow monster kept him on the run... but once in a while, he would stop and make a friend or two. (Rudolph is playing with the polar bear cubs, but then their mother growls, telling Rudolph to leave) But it wouldn't last long, and Rudolph would be on his own again. But during all that time, a strange and wonderful thing was happening... Rudolph was growing up, and growing up made Rudolph realize that you can't run away from your troubles. And pretty soon he knew where he had to go: home."    
(When Rudolph returns Christmas Town, the other reindeer begin to make fun of him again)  
  
Reindeer: "You! I thought you were gone for good. (to other reindeer) Hey, look who's back: old Neon Nose!"  
  
Rudolph: (enters his cave) "Mom? Pa? I'm home!"  
  
Santa: "They're gone, Rudolph. They've been gone for months, out looking for you."  
  
Rudolph: "Clarice?"  
  
Santa: "She's gone, too, and I'm very worried. Christmas Eve is only two days off, and without your father, I'll never be able to get my sleigh off the ground."  
  
Rudolph: "Gone? I'll find him, sir. I'll find them all."  
  
Sam the Snowman: (voice-over) "Well, he was just about to leave when suddenly... (fades to the snowstorm, showing a shingle from the castle's roof being blown away) It hit! (showing the wind blowing away two Eskimos and their igloo) The storm of storms, and only two days before Christmas Eve."  
  
(Christmas trees are being denuded of their ornaments, and elves are struggling to hold on to their packages)  
  
Sam the Snowman: (voice-over) "Now, Rudolph knew that he had to find his folks right away, and he knew where he had to look: the cave of the Abominable Snow Monster.  
  
(Rudolph looks inside, and to sees his parents and Clarice being held captive by Bumble. Bumble picks up Clarice)  
  
Rudolph: (to Bumble) "Put her down!"  
  
(Rudolph charges at Bumble with lowered antlers. But Bumble breaks off a stalactite and uses it as a club, knocking Rudolph out).  
  
<<Scene fades back to Sam, who shields himself with his umbrella, shuddering as he envisions the scene>>  
  
Sam the Snowman: "Ooohh! Tell me when it's over. Oh, where was I? Their last chance. Not quite. You see, ever since Rudolph left them, Hermey and Yukon Cornelius had tried to find their friend. Well, they arrived in Christmastown just as the storm hit, and it was a good thing that I sent them right out after Rudolph."  
  
Hermey: (points to the Bumble's cave)    
"Hey, look!"  
  
Yukon: (to his team): "Whoah! WHOAH! Un-mush, will ya?!"  
  
(They approach the cave's entrance and peek in)  
  
Hermey: 'What do we do? We can't let that monster get ahold of them."  
  
Yukon: "I've got an idea. Listen." (whispers into Hermey's ear)  
  
Hermey: "Uh-huh. Yes. And then? (Yukon whispers again) Not bad. It might work."  
  
(Inside, the three reindeer surround Rudolph's unconscious body)  
  
Clarice: (crying) "Oh, why doesn't he get it over with?"  
  
Rudolph: (coming to) "Pa? Ma? Clarice!"  
  
Hermey: "Are you sure we can get him to come out here?"  
  
Yukon: (climbs up onto the top of the cave's entrance) "Never knew the Bumble snow monster yet who'd turn down a pork dinner for deer meat. Do your stuff! (Hermey makes pig noises) Put some heart in it! That Bumble's hungry!"  
  
(Hermey oinks loudly, turning Bumble's attention away from the reindeer. As Bumble emerges, Yukon uses his pickaxe to drop a boulder on him)  
  
Yukon: "Wahoo! Terrible weather we've been having. Snow and ice! All right, dentist, you take it from here!"  
  
(Hermey gets to work with his huge pincers)  
  
Rudolph: "It's Yukon Cornelius!"  
  
Yukon: "Ta-da! In person."  
  
Clarice: "We're saved!"  
  
Donner: "Let's get outta here."  
  
(Bumble re-enters his cave, blocking their path)  
  
Yukon: (to Bumble) "Why, blast your hairy bumble hide."  
  
Hermey: (walks underneath Bumble) "Don't let this big blowhard scare you anymore. Just walk right past him."  
  
(Bumble gropes inside his mouth, and discovers that he is now toothless)  
  
Yukon: "I tell you, you're looking at a mighty humble bumble. (Bumble roars) He's nothing without his choppers. Let me at him. Wahoo! (He and his dogs begin driving Bumble backwards to the edge of the cliff. They launch themselves at Bumble, causing all of them to fall off the cliff)  
  
Rudolph and Hermey: "YUKON!"  
  
Rudolph: "He's gone! Oh, he's gone!"  
  
Sam the Snowman: (voice-over) "Well, they are all very sad at the loss of their friend, but they realize that the best thing to do is to get the women back to Christmas Town. So, they make it back, and when everybody hears their story, they start to realize maybe they were a little hard on the misfits. Maybe... misfits have a place, too. Even Santa realizes that maybe... HE was wrong."  
  
Santa: "Rudolph, I promise, as soon as this storm lets up, I'll find homes for all those misfit toys."  
  
Foreman Elf: (to Hermey) "All right. You can open up a dentist office. Next week, after Christmas."  
  
Hermey: "Come here. Open your mouth. Oh, dear. Tsk tsk tsk. I'd better set up an appointment for you: week from Tuesday, 4:30-- sharp!"  
  
Donner: "And I'm sorry, too, Rudolph, for the way I acted."  
  
(A loud knock is heard on the doors, and a man's voice is heard):    
"Open up! It isn't a fit night out for man nor beast!"  
  
(two elves open the doors, letting in a swirl of snow, and Yukon Cornelius, accompanied by his five dogs, enters)  
  
Yukon: "Here's the man... (pulls on a rope to reveal Bumble) and here's the beast! Now, calm down, calm down. I reformed this Bumble! He wants a job. Looky what he can do! (Bumble places a star on the top of the Christmas tree) And he doesn't even need a stepladder!"  
  
Rudolph: "But...but...you went over the side of the cliff!"  
  
Yukon: "Didn't I ever tell you about Bumbles? Bumbles bounce!"  
  
(Delighted laughter)  
  
<<The elves are working busily, with their "We are Santa's Elves" song playing in the background>>  
  
Sam the Snowman: (voice-over) "Well, as good as everyone feels, this is no time for celebrating, because the next day is Christmas Eve; the biggest day of the year."  
  
(Santa and Mrs. Claus are in their dinning room)  
  
Mrs. Claus: "Eat, Papa, eat."  
  
Santa: "How can I eat? That silly elf song is driving me crazy."  
  
Mrs. Claus: "You're going to disappoint the children. They expect a fat Santa."  
  
Aviator Elf: (to Santa Claus) "Latest weather report, sir."  
  
Santa: "Well, this is it. The storm won't subside by tonight. We...we'll have to cancel Christmas."  
  
Mrs. Claus: "Papa, are you sure?"  
  
Santa: "Everything's grounded! Oh, the poor kids. They've been so good this year, too. But I couldn't chance it. I'll have to tell everybody that it's all off this year. (He goes to the big Hall, where everybody is busily working) "Quiet! Quiet! Please, everybody quiet! Quiet! I've got some bad news, folks. Christmas is going to be canceled. (everybody gasps) There's nothing I can do. This weather-- (just then, Rudolph's nose glows near Santa's face) Rudolph, Rudolph, please! Could you tone it down a bit? I mean, that nose of yours. I-- (he gazes in amazed realization at Rudolph's nose) That nose! That beautiful, wonderful nose!"  
  
Rudolph: "Huh?"  
  
Santa: (joyfully) "Rudolph, Christmas is not off, and you're going to lead my team!"  
  
Rudolph: "I am?"  
  
Santa: "Yes, sir. (Rudolph's nose glows brighter) You and that wonderful nose of yours."  
  
Rudolph: "My nose, sir?"  
  
Santa: "Ho, ho, ho! From what I see now, that'll cut through the murkiest storm they can dish up. What I'm trying to say is... Rudolph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"  
  
Rudolph: "It will be an honor, sir."  
  
(Everyone cheers)  
  
Donner: (to his wife) "I knew that nose would be useful someday. I knew it all along!"
