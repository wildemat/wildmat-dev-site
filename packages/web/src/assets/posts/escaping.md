### Building the Foundation

This last year I've finally stayed consistent with exercise, sleep, and daily meditation. I thought this would fix all my problems!

These habits helped build a foundation for me to finally leave behind a huge amount of time spent on scrolling, short-form videos, video games, gambling, bad eating habits, late nights and late mornings, and just a general lack of intentionality in my days. But somehow, I've felt an exhausting amount of information overload ever since changing habits and decreasing how much time I give to mind-numbing behavior.

No doubt I now feel objectively happier and more alive. I find excitement in activities I never thought I would be able to enjoy again (quiet walks, reading a book, sitting with my kids and being really present). I now believe that I can really change who I am, and I've proven to myself that I can be consistent with behaviors that used to seem so difficult and full of friction. I believe my mind has become more "flexible" and is much more prepared to learn and grow. Huge improvements that I'm very grateful for. No reason to discount these incredible benefits for what they are. It's taken a lot of work and I don't take the results for granted.

Here's where I start to find this new complexity: with the more stable flow of dopamine I get throughout the day, I've felt an influx of "good" ideas come to mind. Every day, it seems. Without the numbing behavior, my mind seeks out and soaks up more. Ironically, I've been feeling much less satisfied lately, and it's been confusing for me to grapple with.

I've had ADHD symptoms my whole life and always attributed them to middle-child experiences and a world that revolves more and more around screens. Typical dopamine-overload behavior. For me, numbing activities have always been commonplace and were my go-to method of coping with frustration, stress, and insecurity. My escapism has helped me get through many difficulties, and I've even managed to hold down jobs and support a family -- no doubt with a lot of support from my very patient spouse and family.

I figured all those issues would solve themselves after fixing some core life habits. In a big way, the escapism has indeed faded, mostly receding to the background of my mind, no longer yelling at me to lean on it in every adversarial situation. But I think I'm finding a new kind of escapism. Not nearly as unhealthy or damaging as indulging in short-term addictive habits, but nonetheless difficult to understand.

My mind has finally been able to move on from the "emergency mode" it was so often stuck in. I'd always been bouncing between highs and lows, progress and regression, presence and escapism, with no more than two to eight weeks of consistency with any healthy habit.

I've been taking a low-dose ADHD stimulant medication for six months as well as a mood stabilizer. This is after years of notes, counsel with family and therapists, and most importantly, only after I was consistent with core healthy habits for several months. Before I medicated, I wanted to have a baseline of emotional and physical health so I could really measure any positive or negative impact. Sure enough, the benefit from both medications has been noticeable and very positive. They've helped keep a steady, alert mind -- and most importantly, help me adapt to curveballs thrown by a busy life as a father of four young kids.

Meds don't solve everything, though. I didn't expect them to. Focus, mood, and adaptability have improved. I'm very happy with all these improvements and would be content with staying in a state like this for the rest of my life, rolling with the punches. I realize it's a bit dangerous to always be unsatisfied with personal progress and to let the insatiable need for self-improvement take over. But now that the "emergency" behavior is more under control, it seems like the logical next step for other improvements to take center stage.

### The Shiny Object Trap

Shouldn't I be a boss at everything in life now? All these things that have held me back don't hold as much sway anymore, so... what? Unlimited potential? Exponential growth into a superhuman, perfect-life-social-media-type situation? What I actually need are goals and vision -- things that my short-term dopamine way of life never really made room for. I need reflection and accountability. I need to prioritize and organize.

Instead of powerful urges to waste time, numb, or escape, my clearer mind invites tons of creative thoughts and ideas. I work in software, and that opens endless opportunities to create, especially with the insane pace enabled by LLMs. Everything seems possible. Everything sounds interesting, doable, and VERY IMPORTANT. That's the problem for me. Compared to the "garbage" overwhelming my mind for so long, it seems like this year continues to introduce only "good, great, awesome, fun, exciting, useful" ideas. "Should I build a shelf in the garage for this random tool? Yeah, totally! Remember when you'd just play games and gamble? This is way more productive! Do it! Now!" So I proceed to burn four hours on that in the middle of a workday.

I have hundreds and hundreds of notes full of thoughts, ideas, and plans for work and personal life. Each day introduces new ones that seem more important and exciting than the ten I wrote down the day before. I have hundreds of YouTube videos saved to playlists, each one added under the thought of "oh, I'm definitely going to refer to this again." You see the pattern. I fill my days with things that are much better than numbing escapism. I add more and more to my plate and feel the insatiable need to consume more of this "good stuff" and not let any of it go. I record long video monologues explaining my ideas, write journal entries about things I'm learning, bookmark tabs, and add articles to my reading list. So much "good" information and good intentions, saved in so many places.

However, hardly anything gets done. Maybe 1% actually makes it into reality. The rest? Locked away somewhere in some spark of a neural pathway in my brain, destined to never get recalled, reflected on, or implemented. Make no mistake -- I try my best to implement EVERYTHING, all the time, without any sense of order or system. Get 70% done with a coding idea, then 10% done with a fitness plan, halfway through a book about journaling, bounce bounce bounce across the sea of shiny objects that all seem "very good, worthwhile, valuable, important" compared to the island of escapism I've felt trapped on for years.

So why do I finish most of my days feeling mentally drained and unsatisfied? So much consumption. "But it's good stuff to consume, right? We need this for later, right? This is actually super interesting, so we should do it, right?" So many good intentions. I don't trust myself to retain information. I feel the burning need to record every good idea and hoard information that seems important. Why does my mind feel better after braindumping for 30 minutes even though none of what I wrote down will be used later? There's no cycle of reflection, planning, and accountability built in.

### Facing Executive Function

What's missing? I need an assistant that knows how and when to say "YES" and "NO" (mostly the latter). If all this new stuff bouncing around in my head is so good and important compared to the numbing behaviors of the past, then what is worth keeping front of mind? Who is going to separate the "good," "better," and "best"? Do I really have ADHD? Does my executive functioning truly fall short when I need it most? Is it smoke and mirrors, or does my mind really have a weak muscle there that needs training?

I've gotten so used to skipping over my executive functioning. Others see it clear as day in the behaviors outlined above. I'm usually in denial about it. But I've suffered from this -- no doubt. At work, at home, socially. I once missed the entire trick-or-treat evening on Halloween night with my kids and our friends because I was at home trying to finish a monstrosity of a costume that never ended up working. I left with a half-finished costume to meet up with them, only to find it had been three hours and they were on their way back. I was devastated. How could I let this happen? How could I not just stop myself and see what was the higher priority? I've always been so good at fooling myself into picking the shiny object over the dull one that was the better choice all along.

I believe I've associated my "executive functioning" with some type of nanny character in my brain that will only ever say "NO." "Better not let these cool ideas get to my executive functioning, otherwise they'll probably get shut down as 'not important right now.' That's lame. So I'm just going to do it. After all, it's not even a harmful idea!" Yeah, but any good thing can be a bad thing in the wrong context.

So here I am, coming to the realization that my executive functioning:

1. Has apparently not been working like others' ("neurotypical") throughout my life
2. Gets ignored by the rest of my mind
3. Feels to me like a strict parent bossing around a toddler (I'm the toddler)

That leaves me with some real questions:

1. How do I exercise my executive functioning more?
2. How do I build trust in myself that I can lead an exciting life with shiny objects even after filtering all the "things" through a strong prioritization standard?
3. How do I get help from others and stay accountable?

An important caveat here: I'm aware and grateful that the only reason I have the headspace and peace of mind to ponder and come to such realizations is through the help of God, my family and the access to good people and resources around me that I trust. I know many people share these and other, worse struggles. They might have no possible way, or idea, of where to start.

As for my case, I think I'm ready to finally say "NO" to a lot of this "good" noise, because it's brought me to the realization that too much of anything "good", is not giving me the results I truly desire.

I'd much prefer a few "greats" that actually get the time of day to be manifested in reality.
